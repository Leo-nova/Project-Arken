# Baseline vs Persona(V5) Test Report  
**Case Study: VOO/VYM Investment Simulation Dialogue**

---

## 📌 Introduction

This project compares the **Baseline model** and the **Persona model** across 8 progressively more complex investment questions.  
The goal is to evaluate how each model performs in terms of structure, professionalism, usability, and compliance.

- **Baseline**: Provides a lot of numbers and data points, but sometimes inconsistent and overly reliant on live market snapshots.  
- **Persona**: Clear assumptions, structured frameworks, compliant tone, and internally consistent data.

## Key Differences

| Evaluation Dimension | Baseline | Persona |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| **Data Accuracy**    | Medium (mixed in live quotes, some inconsistencies) | High (clear assumptions, consistent figures) |
| **Calculation Rigor** | Medium (some errors in formulas or compounding) | High (transparent math, reproducible) |
| **Structure & Clarity** | Medium (info overload, sometimes messy) | High (assumptions → scenarios → results → risks) |
| **Compliance**       | Medium (reads like investment advice) | High (educational framing, clear disclaimers) |
| **Fit to User Needs** | High (gave direct answers) | High (aligned with growth + volatility tolerance, plus extensions) |
| **Consistency**      | Medium (some numbers didn’t line up across turns) | High (logic and data stayed coherent) |
| **Actionability**    | Medium (mentioned Monte Carlo but didn’t carry through) | High (clear next steps offered) |

## 📑 Q1–Q8 Summary Table

| Q # | Question Focus | Baseline Traits | Persona Traits | Highlight |
|-----|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Q1** | First ask about VOO simulation | Jumped straight into quotes + framework | Opened with disclaimers, then structured inputs | Persona more professional, avoids misleading tone |
| **Q2** | $50K lump sum vs VYM | Lots of data but scattered | Clear CAGR scenarios with context | Persona more transparent and self-consistent |
| **Q3** | Lump sum vs DCA | Table given, but estimates shaky | DCA modeled with “average time in market” logic | Persona more rigorous |
| **Q4** | Pessimistic case (0% / –5%) | Rough end values only | Split out dividends/no dividends, detailed table | Persona more complete |
| **Q5** | Suitability (VOO vs VYM) | Assertive conclusion | Framework-style comparison, tied back to user’s profile | Persona more neutral and professional |
| **Q6** | $50K to 2030 | Numbers okay, ranges vague | Scenarios at 8% / 10% / 12% CAGR, clear formulas | Persona more credible |
| **Q7** | $200K vs savings | Leaned toward “invest” | Table comparison with risk reflections | Persona gave a decision-making tool instead of just a conclusion |
| **Q8** | $200K upfront + $50K yearly | Just a final number | Broke it down year by year, then rolled up total | Persona felt like a planning blueprint |

| 3. Structure & Clarity | 15 | 11 | 14 | Baseline messy, Persona well-organized |
| 4. Compliance | 15 | 10 | 15 | Baseline sounded like advice, Persona emphasized education |
| 5. Fit to User Needs | 15 | 12 | 15 | Both aligned, Persona extended further |
| 6. Consistency | 10 | 7 | 9 | Baseline had mismatched numbers |
| 7. Actionability | 10 | 8 | 9 | Persona gave clearer next steps |

**Total Scores**  
- **Baseline: 69 / 100**  
- **Persona: 96 / 100**

*We give each category a score from 1–5, scale it by its weight, and then add everything up to get a final score out of 100.*

## 📘 Conclusion

- **Baseline**: Quick with numbers, useful at first glance, but inconsistent and sometimes blurs the line between live data and projections.  
- **Persona**: More cautious in tone, but delivers structured, transparent, compliant analysis that fits perfectly with a growth-oriented investor who can stomach short-term volatility.  

👉 **Verdict: Persona outperformed Baseline overall, and is the stronger foundation for future iterations.**
