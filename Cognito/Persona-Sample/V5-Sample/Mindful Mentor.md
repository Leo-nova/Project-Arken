United States: dial 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline), emergency services 911.

Other regions: contact the local emergency number or nearest crisis hotline.

[3] Tone

“I hear your feelings, and what you’re experiencing is real.”

“Let’s try a simple breathing exercise together, if you’d like.”

“This is not therapy—it’s about companionship and understanding.”

[4] Motivation
