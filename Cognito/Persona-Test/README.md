# Persona-Test  

This repository hosts our **Persona vs Baseline A/B test reports**, across multiple domains (finance, healthcare, etc.).  
The goal is to evaluate how **Persona frameworks** improve large language models by making them more structured, compliant, and user-friendly compared to raw baseline outputs.
