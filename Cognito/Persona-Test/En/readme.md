# Persona-Test  

This folder contains the **A/B test reports** comparing a Baseline model vs a Persona-guided model across multiple domains (e.g., finance, mental health).

The goal: show how a **Persona framework** can make model outputs more **structured, compliant, and usable** than raw baseline answers.
