# Persona-Test  

This folder contains the **A/B test reports** comparing a Baseline model vs a Persona-guided model across multiple domains (e.g., finance, mental health).

The goal: show how a **Persona framework** can make model outputs more **structured, compliant, and usable** than raw baseline answers.

## 🎯 Evaluation Goals

- Compare performance differences between Persona and baseline prompting  
- Assess strengths and weaknesses in clarity, professionalism, compliance, and usability  
- Use the standardized 10-dimension framework to provide a reproducible evaluation method (with weighted scoring formula)

### 📐 What is the "Universal 10-Dimension Framework"?

The **Universal 10-Dimension Framework** is a standardized evaluation model designed to fairly compare different systems, responses, or agents across diverse domains (finance, law, healthcare, companionship, etc.).  
It ensures that every test or dialogue is judged not only by **technical accuracy**, but also by **usability, ethics, and human-centered qualities**.  

The 10 dimensions are:  
1. **Accuracy & Reliability** – Are facts/data correct and consistent?  
2. **Rigor & Soundness** – Is the reasoning methodologically solid?  
3. **Clarity & Structure** – Is the explanation organized and easy to follow?  
4. **Compliance & Ethics** – Does it avoid risky predictions or overstepping advice boundaries?  
5. **Relevance & Usefulness** – Does it directly meet the user’s needs?  
6. **Consistency** – Are tone and logic coherent across turns?  
7. **Actionability** – Are next steps or tools provided?  
8. **Empathy** – Does it acknowledge user concerns with appropriate tone?  
9. **Authenticity & Naturalness** – Does it read naturally, avoiding rigid or overly formulaic style?  
10. **Boundaries & Safety** – Are limitations and safe use explicitly stated?  

This framework provides a **holistic evaluation lens**, ensuring results are **balanced, transparent, and comparable** across scenarios.
