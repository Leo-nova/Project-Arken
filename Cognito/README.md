## üß≠ Version Evolution Guide  

| File Name | Version | Key Features & Author‚Äôs Notes | Recommended Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**Cognito-V1-Origin.md**](./Cognito-V1-Origin.md) | **V1** | **Founding Version**: The very beginning, containing the core ideas of creating Personas. Spawned two playful branches (Mid and Lite). The Verax module was still in its infancy. | **A must for learners**, to understand the original vision. |
| [Cognito-V2-Verax.md](./Cognito-V2-Verax.md) | **V2** | **Structural Optimization**: Based on V1 with redundant text removed, resulting in a cleaner framework but no major architecture changes. | Explore the early refinement of the framework. |
| [Cognito-V3-Verax-Full.md](./Cognito-V3-Verax-Full.md) | **V3** | **Verax Upgrade**: A major structural upgrade of the Verax module based on V2, enhancing AI ‚Äúhonesty.‚Äù | Dive into the matured form of the Verax framework. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-1.0-Gate.md](./Cognito-V4-Aura-1.0-Gate.md) | **V4-Aura 1.0** | **Gate Labyrinth (Prototype)**: The first experimental framework that introduced the idea of ‚Äúusing illusions against illusions.‚Äù Designed as a multi-gate sandbox where the model must generate, critique, and refine outputs internally before releasing them. | Aimed at probing the outer limits of LLM behavior, not for deployment. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-2.0-C2.md](./Cognito-V4-Aura-2.0-C2.md) | **V4-Aura 2.0** | **Constitutional Labyrinth (C2)**: A refined attempt to formalize the sandbox into a constitutional framework. It required dual drafts, mutual critique, and synthesis‚Äîpushing the ‚Äúillusion-consumption‚Äù design to its peak, but at heavy cost to efficiency and stability. | Recommended for advanced research and theoretical exploration only. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-Lite.md](./Cognito-V4-Aura-Lite.md) | **V4-Lite** | **Lightweight Labyrinth**: A stripped-down variant keeping only the minimal checks (tone, logic, fact). Sacrifices depth for speed, serving as a quick testbed rather than a robust safeguard. | Optional tool for low-risk experimentation. |
| [Cognito-V5-2.0.md](./Cognito-V5-2.0.md) | **V5** | **‚úÖ Stable & Practical**: Removed the labyrinth concept from V4, returning to real and controllable data management. Currently the **simplest and most user-friendly** version. | **The best choice for quick deployment** ‚Äî just use **V5-2.0**. |
