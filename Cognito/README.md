# Cognito Framework Version Library  

Welcome to the core repository of the Cognito Framework!  
Here you will find the complete evolution of Cognito ‚Äî from the initial concept to the latest stable release.  

To help you quickly locate the version you need, please refer to the **Version Evolution Guide** below.

## üß≠ Version Evolution Guide  

| File Name | Version | Key Features & Author‚Äôs Notes | Recommended Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**Cognito-V1-Origin.md**](./Cognito-V1-Origin.md) | **V1-Origin** | **Founding Version**: The original blueprint that defined Cognito‚Äôs identity. Introduced the early **Verax module** (skepticism, counter-questions, uncertainty flags) and the 9-field Persona template. | **For learners**: Essential to understand the original vision and purpose of Cognito. |
| [Cognito-V1-Mid.md](./Cognito-V1-Mid.md) | **V1-Mid** | **Intermediate Refinement**: A trimmed-down version of V1-Origin. Removed redundant wording, kept Verax and Persona generation, and adopted a more supportive, assistant-like tone. | **For prototyping**: Useful for consultants/designers to quickly generate roles. |
| [Cognito-V1-Lite.md](./Cognito-V1-Lite.md) | **V1-Lite** | **Lightweight Variant**: Radically simplified version focusing on friendliness. Reduced to three basic prompts (what to do / how to speak / where to use), while keeping a minimal self-harm safety clause. | **For very beginners**: A gentle entry point for casual persona experiments. |
| [Cognito-V2-Verax.md](./Cognito-V2-Verax.md) | **V2** | **Structural Optimization**: Streamlined framework based on V1. Maintains Verax but emphasizes cleaner, more concise outputs. A transitional step before major Verax expansion. | **For exploration**: Good for experimenting with Verax integration in personas. |
| [Cognito-V3-Verax-Full.md](./Cognito-V3-Verax-Full.md) | **V3** | **Verax Expansion**: A full upgrade of the Verax module. Enforces fact-checking routines, explicit boundary handling, and stricter rejection of overreach. Prioritizes honesty over fluency. | **For research**: Ideal for testing Verax-driven behavior and truthfulness. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-1.0-Gate.md](./Cognito-V4-Aura-1.0-Gate.md) | **V4-Aura 1.0** | **Gate Labyrinth (Prototype)**: First experimental framework introducing the ‚Äúillusion vs. illusion‚Äù sandbox. The model must generate, critique, and refine internally before releasing outputs. Ambitious but inefficient. | **For research only**: Probing the outer behavioral limits of LLMs. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-2.0-C2.md](./Cognito-V4-Aura-2.0-C2.md) | **V4-Aura 2.0** | **Constitutional Labyrinth (C2)**: A refined attempt that required dual drafts, mutual critique, and synthesis. Pushed the ‚Äúillusion consumption‚Äù design to its peak but suffered from **heavy cost and self-critique instability**. | **For advanced research**: Theoretical exploration, not practical deployment. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-Lite.md](./Cognito-V4-Aura-Lite.md) | **V4-Lite** | **Lightweight Labyrinth**: Stripped down to the bare minimum (tone, logic, fact checks). Sacrifices depth for speed, acting as a quick testbed rather than a safeguard. | **For low-risk experiments**: Optional tool for quick trials. |
| [Cognito-V5-1.0.md](./Cognito-V5-1.0.md) | **V5-1.0** | **Architect‚Äôs Draft**: Abandoned the ‚Äúillusion labyrinth‚Äù of V4. Introduced engineering workflows (jurisdiction scan, PACT analysis, design proposal, red-team checks). First appearance of the **compliance priority rule**. | **For experimentation**: Best for exploring full design workflows. |
| [Cognito-V5-2.0.md](./Cognito-V5-2.0.md) | **V5-2.0** | **‚úÖ Stable & Deployable**: Refined from 1.0 with stronger red-team protocols (AML/KYC, fraud, internal reasoning traps). Clearly defined output formats (Micro / Standard / Deep-Dive). The simplest and most reliable version to date. | **For deployment**: The recommended release for production-like use. |

## üìñ Recommended Paths  

- **üå± For Beginners**: Start with [Cognito-V1-Origin.md](./Cognito-V1-Origin.md) and follow the versions in order to experience the journey from idea to maturity.  
- **üöÄ For Quick Deployment**: Directly use [Cognito-V5-2.0.md](./Cognito-V5-2.0.md), which is the most stable and efficient release.
