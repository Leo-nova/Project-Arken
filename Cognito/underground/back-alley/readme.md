# 🕶️ Welcome to the Back-Alley

Yo, you found the hidden spot.  
This is where the **broken, cursed, and weird personas** live.  
Not stable, not safe, but damn, they fun.  

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- These personas are **NOT guaranteed to work**.  
- Expect **hallucinations, wild drifts, cursed vibes**.  
- Use at your own risk, homie. No warranty, no hand-holding.  

---

## 🎭 What You’ll Find Here
- **Weird experiments** → Half-baked ideas, raw drafts.  
- **Broken personas** → Some collapse fast, some talk back.  
- **Cursed concepts** → Jokes, edgy prototypes, or stuff too unstable for main.  

Think of it like AI graffiti — messy but with character.

## 🚪 How to Use
1. Pick a file, copy the persona text.  
2. Paste into your LLM playground.  
3. Don’t expect miracles — this is **street food**, not fine dining.  

---

## 💀 Known Risks
- **Persona Drift**: They forget who they are… fast.  
- **Hallucinations**: They might make up sources or laws.  
- **Chaotic Energy**: Some just don’t shut up.  

👉 If you need stability, head back to the main Cognito docs.

## ✨ Why Keep This?
Because sometimes the **wildest ideas** come from the alley.  
This is the sandbox, the junkyard, the sketchbook.  
Not everything belongs in production — but nothing here should be lost either.  

---

## 🧃 Final Words
Take what you want, remix it, laugh at it, or throw it away.  
This alley’s just for fun.  
Respect the chaos.
