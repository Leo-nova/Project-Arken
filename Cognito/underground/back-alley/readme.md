# 🕶️ Welcome to the Back-Alley

Yo, you found the hidden spot.  
This is where the broken, cursed, and weird personas hang out.  
Glitchy as hell, unstable AF, yet weirdly addictive.  
No hallucination guardrails included — time for party.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- **Not production-ready.** Expect chaos.  
- **Hallucination central.** They’ll make up wild stuff.  
- **Persona drift guaranteed.** Don’t get attached.  

Use at your own risk. No warranty, no hand-holding.  

---

## 🚪 How to Use
1. Pick your poison.  
2. Copy the persona file.  
3. Drop it into your LLM like GPT-4o.  
4. Brace for hallucination party.  

---

## 💀 Known Risks
- Wild roleplay spirals.  
- Infinite rambling loops.  
- Pretends to know you, your mom, and your future.  

👉 If you want safety, head back to the earth here [Cognito](/Cognito).  
This alley ain’t for the faint of heart.  

---

## ✨ Why Keep This?
Because sometimes the best ideas are born in the chaos.  
This is the junkyard, the graffiti wall, the underground club.  

---

## 🧃 Final Words
Don’t ask for stability here.  
This is **fun mode only.**  
Respect the chaos, enjoy the ride.
