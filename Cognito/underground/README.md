# YOOOOOO, WHAT’S UP OG!!!  
COME AND MEET MY COGNITO, BRO！🔥  

Yo listen up — this ain’t your grandma’s prompt template.  
This is **Cognito Framework**, the real deal when it comes to building AI personas that don’t trip, don’t hallucinate (well… not too much 👀), and always keep it 100.  

---

## 🚀 What’s the deal, fam?  
LLMs be spittin’ words, but that don’t mean they’re *truthful*.  
Cognito got your back — keeps your AI on track, no random BS, no dry talk.  
It’s the script that makes your bot feel like family.  

---

## 🤔 So what’s a Persona, bruh?  
- **Knowledge base** → gives depth, like your homie who knows the streets.  
- **Role prompt** → keeps the style consistent, like your favorite mixtape.  
- **Chat history** → memory on lock, so your AI don’t forget your name, fam.  

Why you need it?  
- People vibe better when AI got a personality.  
- Boring, soulless bots? Dead on arrival.  
- A good persona = **trust + consistency + less hallucination**.
- Stable like grandma’s secret recipe 🍲

---

## ⚡ Quick Start, homie  
1. Slide into the [`Cognito`](/Cognito/) folder.  
2. Grab [**Cognito-V1-Origin.md**](/Cognito/Cognito-V1-Origin.md).  
3. Paste it into your LLM, tell it what kinda homie you want (teacher, hype-man, a unicorn).  
4. BOOM — now your AI talks like family.  

Or if you’re a pro?  
Skip the warm-up and use [**Cognito-V5-2.0.md**](/Cognito/Cognito-V5-2.0.md) — stable, balanced, real solid, no cap.

## 🧩 Version Evolution Guide (Street Edition)  

| File | Version | The Real Talk | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Cognito-V1-Origin.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V1-Origin.md) | **V1-Origin** | **Day-One OG**: The raw blueprint. Big, messy, but where the dream started. Verax just a baby back then. | History lesson, fam. See where it all began. |
| [Cognito-V1-Mid.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V1-Mid.md) | **V1-Mid** | **Lean & Mean**: Trimmed the fat, kept the muscle. No Verax, but smoother flow. | Quick prototyping, like a demo tape. |
| [Cognito-V1-Lite.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V1-Lite.md) | **V1-Lite** | **Pocket Size Persona**: Just three questions. Friendly, lightweight. Still keeps a lil’ safety check. | For beginners, testing the waters. |
| [Cognito-V2-Verax.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V2-Verax.md) | **V2** | **The Clean-Up Crew**: Same house, less clutter. Verax still in the game, just sharper. | Try it if you wanna experiment with Verax vibes. |
| [Cognito-V3-Verax-Full.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V3-Verax-Full.md) | **V3** | **Beast Mode Verax**: Honesty police on steroids. Fact-checks, hard rejections, no overreach. | Research fam only, this one strict. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-1.0-Gate.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V4-Aura-1.0-Gate.md) | **V4-Gate** | **The Maze Era**: Illusion fightin’ illusion. AI runnin’ circles before it talks. Crazy but wild to watch. | Pure lab experiment. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-2.0-C2.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V4-Aura-2.0-C2.md) | **V4-C2** | **Double Draft Hustle**: Two drafts battle, critique, then merge. Ambitious, but heavy AF. | Theory heads only, not for real streets. |
| [Cognito-V4-Aura-Lite.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V4-Aura-Lite.md) | **V4-Lite** | **Slim Maze**: Just tone, logic, fact checks. Fast but flimsy. | Low-risk play, quick test vibes. |
| [Cognito-V5-1.0.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V5-1.0.md) | **V5-1.0** | **Architect’s Draft**: Dropped the maze. Back to reality. Jurisdiction checks, red-team hustle. Compliance on top. | For experimenting the full workflow. |
| [Cognito-V5-2.0.md](/Cognito/Cognito-V5-2.0.md) | **V5-2.0** | **Street-Ready Release** ✅: Stronger red-team, formats on lock (Micro, Standard, Deep-Dive). Clean, solid, real talk only. | The go-to. Stable, ready for action. |

## 👊 Why Cognito?  
- Flexible as hell.  
- Fast to set up.  
- Keeps your AI from talking nonsense when convos go long.  
- Tell the Cognito you don't need Verax or Aura for fun(plz don't do that).

## ✍️ Author’s Note  
I ain’t no engineer. Just a dude tired of AI spittin’ trash.  
So I built this, text-only, no fancy toys — so anyone can keep it safe and keep it real.

## 📜 License  
MIT, homie. Do whatever — just give props.

yoo... word on the street is, there’s a [back-alley](./back-alley/) full of broken, cursed personas.  
Not safe, not stable — but damn, they fun.
