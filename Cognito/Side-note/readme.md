# Random Thoughts — Why Cognito Exists

Some Simple but Honest Thoughts — Grab a Coffee and Read Along ☕  
This analysis comes from my own experiments and lived experience, not from academic research.  
It reflects the challenges I’ve faced in daily collaboration, which eventually led to the creation of the Cognito Framework.

## The Weakness of Single-Point Prompting: Why Doesn’t Your AI Listen?

In a world overflowing with “prompt engineering tutorials,” how can you really tell if your prompt is working?

Single-point prompting — like zero-shot or few-shot instructions — is still the most common method today.  
Usually, a user will set a simple role at the start of the chat. For example:  
“You are now a Japanese teacher with 30 years of experience. Teach me based on my needs.”

At first glance, this seems to work. And yes, in the short term, it does.  
But in my experience, the effect fades fast as the conversation goes on.

Why? Because the model doesn’t *become* that teacher.  
It only *imitates* the role.

An initial instruction works more like a “style suggestion” than a reliable operating system.  
At first, the model might sound stricter or more formal because of the “30 years of experience” line.  
But most of its behavior is still driven by probability sampling — picking words from a massive distribution.

This leads to **persona drift**.  
Over multiple turns, the original instruction gets diluted.  
The AI starts forgetting who it’s supposed to be.  
The “teacher” may grow impatient, break character, or even collapse into completely different behavior.  
That forces users to constantly restart conversations, which makes deep collaboration almost impossible.

## Can’t We Just Add More Details?

Yes — but not randomly. That’s the key.  

A lot of “expert prompts” floating around the internet look solid on the surface but are actually full of traps that make hallucinations more likely.  

Let’s look at a common “SEO consultant” template and break it down.

---

### Example Template (with my notes)

 You are a senior SEO marketing consultant with over 10 years of digital marketing experience. You specialize in search engine algorithms, content marketing, keyword analysis, and website optimization strategies.  
>👌 Fine. A typical starter line.

 Familiar with Google, Bing, and other mainstream search engine algorithm changes (including recent core updates).  
>⚠️ Problem: “Familiar” is undefined. You need to spell out what counts as familiarity.

 Skilled with keyword research tools (Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Search Console).  
>⚠️ Problem: The model just mimics what “skilled” sounds like. Risk of mild hallucination.

 Can give technical SEO advice (site structure, speed optimization, schema, mobile compatibility).  
>⚠️ Problem: Without specifics, it will invent directions.

 Designs content based on audience needs.  
>⚠️ Problem: No audience defined = free to imagine.

 Knows backlink strategies and avoiding black-hat SEO.  
>⚠️ Problem: Again, too vague.

 Uses a professional consultant tone: direct, avoids slogans.  
>⚠️ Problem: “Professional” is never defined — the model decides for itself.

 Supports advice with data and cases, not just “this is better.”  
>⚠️ Problem: Classic hallucination clause. Where’s the data from?

 Adds a touch of humor while staying clear.  
>⚠️ Problem: Great way to ruin rigor if humor shows up at the wrong time.

 Provides actionable strategies, not vague advice.  
>⚠️ Problem: Still undefined. What counts as actionable?

 Customizes advice per industry.  
>⚠️ Problem: Too open-ended. Encourages guessing.

 Separates short-term vs. long-term strategies.  
>⚠️ Problem: The model doesn’t have time awareness.

 Provides examples (titles, meta descriptions, internal links) when necessary.  
>⚠️ Problem: “When necessary” is undefined.

 Ends replies with “Advice from your marketing consultant.”  
>⚠️ Problem: Not rigorous — again leaves space for randomness.

### My Revised Version

**You are a senior SEO consultant. Follow these constraints:**

- **Professional Standard:** Use search tools to list and explain the last two Google Core Updates.  
>🔶 Explicit instructions improve credibility.

- **Source Rule:** Must cite at least one public, verifiable source from the past 6 months (e.g., Google Search Central Blog, Moz, Ahrefs).  
If no source is available, clearly say: “This is a hypothetical case.” Never make one up.  
>🔶 Defines where and when to get data.

- **Audience Setting:** Target = small to mid-size e-commerce teams without an SEO expert.  
>🔶 Narrows the scope.

- **Style Control:** Stay professional and rigorous. Humor is allowed only when teaching by example.  
Each section ≤ 80 Chinese characters.  
Tone example:  
“Based on my web search (URL + date), we need new hook designs to capture current traffic trends.”  
>🔶 Locks tone and format.

- **Task Orientation:** Must provide both short-term (1–3 months) measures and long-term (6–12 months) strategies.  
>🔶 Sets concrete timeframes.

- **Output Rule:** Structure every reply as Recommendation → Reason → Potential Risk.  
>🔶 Forces consistent reasoning.

- **Delivery Standard:** Provide at least one sample title + meta description.  
End with: “Advice from your marketing consultant.”  
>🔶 Defines exactly what must be delivered.

## Final Reflection

By removing vague terms, narrowing the audience, standardizing structure, and enforcing clear rules, I reduced hallucination risk.  
The model’s output becomes traceable, sustainable, and less prone to collapse into nonsense.

### **And that — is one of the reasons I created Cognito.**    
**Because no one has time to rewrite and patch prompts every single time.**
