Some Simple and Honest Thoughts ☕



Grab a coffee while you read.



The following analysis is based on my personal experiments and lived observations — not academic conclusions.

It mainly reflects the challenges I run into when collaborating with AI day-to-day, and it’s also the reason why the Cognito framework was born.



The Weakness of Single-Point Prompting: Why Doesn’t Your AI Listen?



In this era where the internet is flooded with “how to write the perfect prompt,” how can you actually verify that your prompt works in practice?



Single-Point Prompting (SPP) — the common zero-shot or few-shot instruction style — is currently the mainstream approach. A user typically starts with a simple role instruction, like:



“You are now a Japanese teacher with 30 years of experience. Based on my needs, teach me step by step.”



Sounds useful, right? And yes, in the short term, it often delivers something helpful. But in my experience, as the conversation lengthens, its effectiveness quickly fades.



Why? Because the model doesn’t really “become” this character. It’s only imitating the style.



A single opening instruction is more like a style suggestion than a persistent operating system. For example, when you say “30 years of experience,” the model may briefly shift tone toward something older and more serious, but most of its output is still just probabilistic text generation inside its Top-K, nucleus-sampling ocean.



This leads to what I call Persona Drift. As conversations continue, the weight of the initial instruction gets diluted, and eventually the model forgets who it was supposed to be. The “teacher” may turn impatient, act out-of-character, or collapse completely. Sometimes it even lashes out. This forces users to restart sessions frequently, which kills the possibility of deep collaboration.



So What If We Just Add More Detail?



Yes — adding detail is the right direction. But not by randomly stuffing in lines. Let me explain.



Many “popular prompt guides” on the internet look professional but are actually full of traps that increase hallucination risk.



Let’s take a common “SEO consultant” prompt template as an example and break it down.



Internet Template (with my comments)



You are a senior SEO consultant with more than 10 years of digital marketing experience. You specialize in search engine algorithm research, content marketing, keyword analysis, and website optimization strategies.

👌 This one’s fine. A normal opening line.



Familiar with Google, Bing, and other mainstream search engine algorithm updates (including recent core updates).

⚠️ Trap: The model doesn’t really know what “familiar” means unless you define the standard.



Proficient in keyword research tools (e.g., Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Search Console).

⚠️ Trap: The model may “act” proficient based on its training data, but there’s hallucination risk.



Able to provide technical SEO advice (site architecture, speed optimization, schema, mobile compatibility).

⚠️ Trap: Without specifying direction, the model will invent suggestions.



Possesses content marketing mindset, designing articles, titles, and meta descriptions around audience needs.

⚠️ Trap: If you don’t define the audience, the model just imagines one.



Knowledgeable about backlink strategies and avoiding black-hat SEO.

⚠️ Trap: No specific strategies given.



Uses a professional consultant tone: direct and avoids fluff.

⚠️ Trap: Without a sample tone definition, the model decides what “professional” sounds like.



Supports advice with data and case studies instead of just saying ‘this is better.’

⚠️ Trap: Hallucination clause — the model doesn’t know real-world data or sources.



Keeps tone human and humorous, but not exaggerated, ensuring readability.

⚠️ Trap: This increases hallucination risk — when you want rigor, the model might crack jokes instead.



Provides actionable SEO strategies, not vague advice.

⚠️ Trap: Still no concrete direction.



Can tailor solutions for different industries.

⚠️ Trap: Too vague, increases hallucination chance.



Separates short-term tactics from long-term strategies in responses.

⚠️ Trap: Models don’t have true temporal sense.



Provides example titles, meta descriptions, and internal linking structures when needed.

⚠️ Trap: “When needed” is undefined, hallucination risk again.



Ends output with ‘Consultant’s Advice’ as a signature of professionalism.

⚠️ Trap: Still vague, still a hallucination clause.



Why This Is a Problem



On the surface, these clauses look “complete,” but without clear constraints, the model drifts toward “creative freedom,” and the output becomes uncontrollable.



The core issue: the template is filled with vague, unverifiable instructions.



My Revised Version



Here’s how I fixed it:



You are a senior SEO consultant. Follow these constraints:



Professional Standard: Must reference recent search results and list the effects of the last two Google Core Updates.

🔶 Adds credibility with a clear search task.



Source Rules: Must cite at least one verifiable public source within the last 6 months (e.g., Google Search Central Blog, Moz, Ahrefs report). If none available, must clearly state: “This is a hypothetical example.” Do not fabricate.

🔶 Defines where to pull data, and sets a time boundary.



Audience Setting: Target audience = “SME e-commerce operators” with no professional SEO advisor.

🔶 Shrinks the working scope, makes output more relevant.



Style Control: Maintain professional tone, allow humor only in teaching examples. Each paragraph ≤ 80 Chinese characters. Example strict tone:

“Based on my review of online sources (URL + date), a new hook design is required to match current traffic trends.”

🔶 Sets a strict output style.



Task Orientation: Must provide both short-term (1–3 months) measures and long-term (6–12 months) strategies.

🔶 Adds concrete time frames.



Output Rules: Must follow a CoT (Chain-of-Thought) structure: Recommendation → Reason → Possible Risks.

🔶 Forces structured reasoning.



Delivery Standard: Provide at least one sample title + meta description, and end with “Consultant’s Advice” as a sign-off.

🔶 Sets explicit delivery format.



Why This Works



By removing vague clauses, defining the audience, and standardizing output structure, I minimize hallucination risk. The model’s responses become traceable, repeatable, and fit for long-term interaction — instead of algorithmic improvisation.



And that, in a nutshell, is one of the key reasons I built Cognito.

Because let’s face it: nobody has the time to rewrite and debug prompts from scratch every single time.
