# 🤝 Contributing  

First of all, thanks for taking the time to check out this little project.  
Most of what you see here is something I co-built with AI,  
so if you want to help out or add something, you’re more than welcome.

## 📝 How you can help
- **Open an Issue**: Found a bug, typo in docs, or just a fun new idea? Open an Issue.  
- **Send a PR**: If you already fixed it yourself, just drop a PR.  
- **Share feedback**: Even if it’s just leaving a “lol” or “can’t believe this works” in Discussions — that already makes my day.

## ⚠️ Notes
- This framework is experimental, no guarantee of stability.  
- Commit messages don’t need to be formal, just make them understandable.  
- If you want to toss in some “weird personas,” please put them in `back-alley/` — that’s the playground for broken or silly stuff.

## 💡 Final words
Don’t take this repo too seriously.  
Just like my early works,  
**it’s meant to be a bit experimental, a bit casual, and always with a touch of humor.**
